A very happy birthday🎂 Aditi. I'm glad that I have a friend like u who can sing so well although I would love to u see dancing as well but anyways 😂 u know girl u are just amazing I love spending time with u oh! I got to know that it's been 9 long years since you've been my friend and I still remember how much we use to have arguments over very small and stupid topics 😂 and I know u are still chhota bachha . It's bad that now we won't be getting enough time to spend with each other which worries me a lot and I guess u know why 😂 and I must say that u are truly💕 a good adviser I love hanging out with you. And ya a very imp. thing nowadays u don't receive my call at very first and u know I don't like if I don't get much attention 😂 but thank god that u do call me back . A very happy birthday 🥳 once again.

              Hey Volcano! 

Thankyou for existing man! I don't say it quite often but you are very important. Thankyou for tolerating me, listening to my bullshit and ofcourse giving me advices which I never followed 😂. You have always been nice to me even when I behaved like an asshole (sorry for that :p). Aside from food and sleep and chocolate and Netflix, you’re my favourite. Meet me soon! 

                I love you bitchy bitch❤️

I'm sorry for all the times that you needed me and I wasn't there for you, for all the times that I did things that made you mad at me and for all the times that I didn't appreciate the cutest being standing by me whenever I was in need.

Hey there Adeetee!
First of all, a very very happy birthday big girl🥳 You’ve been a great bus mate and class mate🤟 It’s been 11 years almost, since we know each other(It’s just Ktk and you who have come this long way🔥😂)
And I may not show it Ms. Boring Road 🤭But I get so so happy when you call me Virat🥳🤩😛
So stay happy, don’t be so angry, and patent the SI unit of anger soon😂🤟.
Once again, a very happy birthday to you and your way too long hair😂🔥

              <p> I could not be the friend you deserved, or probably needed at times. I am sorry for that. I want you to know you have changed me, be it very little, but you have. I have had my own problems and I could not see beyond them. I hope we can reconcile sometime else in life, when I am in a better place. </p>
