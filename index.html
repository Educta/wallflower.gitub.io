            <p><i><big>S</big>aw you sitting,<br>
            quiet and calm.
            <br>Stared at you,
          <br>Deduced your charm.<br>
        <br>Sweet and simple,
      <br>Unique in your own way.
    <br>My ears are ready to listen to your tale.
  <br><br>I've known you for long <br>
          But never noticed this side.
      <br>We've fought a lot,
        <br>Though you were always right.
          <br><br>Some people just go unnoticed,
            <br>Or some sides of them do,
          <br>Yet to be explored,
          <br>yet to leave a clue.
        <br><br>I wonder why I missed it,
      <br>In all those countless hours, <br>
    I wonder why I didn't notice <br>
  This beautiful wallflower.  </i></p>

           <p><i><big>H</big>it my phone <br>
                When you think you'd start to crack.<br>
                And I won't <br> let you fall off your track.
              <br>Hey, just don't
            <br>Forget I've got your back,
          <br>Yeah, I do. I do.
        <br><br>Your fears
       <br>are wrapped
      <br>Around your tears
     <br>When it gets dark,
      <br>It gets hard
         <br>And you can't sleep.
           <br>And darkness prevails
              <br>But it'll fade away.
                 <br><br>I'll be your candle in the dark,
                <br>You don't need to be afraid.
              <br>They can see you from the stars,
             <br>You don't need to be afraid.
            <br><br>I'll be there to cheer you up,
          <br>When you feel low and you're scared,
         <br>I would be one call away,
        <br>You don't need to be afraid. </i></p>

                    But apologies take <br>Poems and songs.
                  <br><br>Now I know this girl, <br>The beautiful wallflower.<br>
                I talked about her before, <br>
              I can still talk for hours. <br><br>
            I think I know her better,<br>
          Better than I used to before.<br>
        It's strange how I barely knew her <br>
      And now our friendship's pure. <br><br>
        The story beyond <br>
          is yet to be explored- <br>
            A beautiful wallflower <br>
              With a beautiful soul. </i> </p>

                      <br>You readily endorse <br>When you come across <br>My pitiful flaws <br>
                    With a slow applause. <br><br>
                  You embrace this friendly bond <br>It's cool and yet it's warm. <br>It's weird as it sounds <br>
                But it's the vibes all around. <br><br>It's a rhyme full of vibes <br>Of our stable-ish lives. <br>Living up to all the highs, <br>
              When lows seem far off our sights <br><br>
            I might not be the best at flirting <br>But I swear I'll suck at hurting. <br><br>I'm not sure if you're a camera
          <br>But I look at you and smile. <br>Girl I need a map, <br>I get lost in your eyes. </i> </p>

                         Latency of the melody that lies in my head <br>Is brought back to life when you are around. <br>
                       Henessy that hangs in the back of my head <br>Comes to life and speaks your name aloud.
                     <br><br>The cold winds can't blow the petals away, <br>It's too strong to give up so soon. <br>Wallflowers go unnoticed or so they say
                   <br>But I did see a wallflower bloom. <br><br>
                 The tighter you hold your fist, <br>The more the sand comes out. <br>I don't want us to be in the past <br>I'll hold you steady and sound. </i> </p>
