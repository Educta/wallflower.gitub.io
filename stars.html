            <span>Hey there</span>
            <br>
            
                        <span>Well well well, sweet panda is sixteen now. I don't really know if this age holds any specific importance since
            I've never been sixteen but toast to another year of a life I know you're gonna live large. I wish you could live forever
          but since that's not possible, sixty nine years doesn't sound bad either. Before you eviscerate my heart out and jump on it,
        let's be done with the other dude inside me. <br><br>

There's a strange anxiety that accompanies the rush of thoughts I wanna pen down here. A good anxiety; the type I like to embrace.
Just a day before your birthday, litfest ended last year. Remember how you were not gonna come on any of the three days of the event but we ended up having the time of our lives in those three days?
That's the time around which I had realized with full confidence that I could share literally anything with you without the fear of being judged. Thanks for always being that friend to me.
Just as kind and nice as you've been to me, I have been quite the opposite on a lot of occassions and you know that well. I'm sorry for that but well, at the end of the day, I'm someone you can
alwas count on because being there for you always is the closest thing I can do to repay the debt of all the things you've done for me, and yes that includes all the stationery you lended me everyday,
investing on my education. ':)


<br><br>
I never realized time flies until I actually started having fun in school and you're to thank for that. Now I'm not whining about not being in school anymore, I'm thanking you for giving me those moments to cherish among many others that are yet to come.
Sure I was a pretentious douchebag for a lot of parts but well you didn't judge me for that.
Even though I've been around in your life for quite a while, I've not known you well for a very long time. I sometimes get jealous of not having grown up at the same place
 but then I let it pass cause my childhood was a great deal of shitting pants and crying rivers which would be really embarassing had I grown up here.
 But I like to think I know you well enough. Not like it's a competition with your childhood friends but I know your cousins,
 I know about your love for space, your love for EDM, your hate for spiders, your fear for Alexa, your messy sleep schedule. I've seen your crushes change from Martin Garrix to Zedd to Andrew Taggart. Okay maybe it is a competition. <br><br>

 Thinking back to how it started with you expressing your sweet spot for One Direction, I feel how such a small thing can trigger such a big change in life.
 You are the best change ever triggered in my life. It makes me feel that 'you only live once' is bullshit. You live everyday, you only die once. <br><br> Happy Birthday once again, have a great day. <3
