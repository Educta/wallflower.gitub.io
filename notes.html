    1st sept <br><br>

    Hey there <br>
    It's 4AM in the morning and I'm finally done making the frontpage of the website. I asked you yesterday if you liked
    colourful stuffs more than classic stuffs. You said classic and then changed to colourful when I said I assumed you like
    colourful stuffs. Well, problem sorted. I mixed both of them. Genius, I know. I woke up at 12:30AM or 1AM and it's
    pretty late now but I'm so excited to show you this website that I can't see a hint of sleep on my face. Do you know, I was
    gonna keep a different background for the front page but my code wasn't working. Midway through writing the code of the other
    background, I realized that I missed a semicolon in the first one -_- One missing semicolon and my keyboard was gonna pay
    the price. I made the page for the poems only using HTML a month ago and I added its link to the frontpage. For the animations
    that I added in the frontpage, I practised the styling language, CSS, for one month and now I'm baffled myself with what I did
    cause I never imagined I could. Okay, these notes are more about my progress with this website so this might bore you so you don't
    necessarily have to read this. I don't think I'm even gonna add these progress notes to the website but let's see. And damn, this is fun. I'm so excited but kinda nervous to see your reaction to this. This is
    my first ever full stack website and I don't wanna disappoint you. <br> <br>

    2nd Sept <br> <br>

    Hey there <br>
    It's 1AM and my internet is barely working I'm so frustrated. I could've finished a lot of work right now. But it's okay, I finished making the page for "MORE"
    which basically includes stuffs you like so in case you're ever bored, you'll always have that page to go to. I'm gonna make a heart out of CSS tomorrow. Our heart.
    Doesn't sound very romantic after I added the term 'CSS.'. I'm jamming to Backstreet boys right now. Damn they're cool. Okay, I'm gonna stop staring at the pages
    I've made and go to sleep. I'm hoping to return to it in the morning and I really hope that the internet works. I'm hoping to finish the website by the end of this month
    and I might get more ideas to add in the future so I'll keep updating it. I've still got to find a way to get an SSL certificate for the website so that bloody google
    doesn't show that the website is not secure. Most of them are paid and I can't transact money online cause I'm not allowed to use net banking.
    Alright I'mma go sleep now. <br><br>

    8th sept <br><br>

    Hey there <br>
    it's 3:35AM right now and I just finished downloading and then adding the book to the website. I couldn't write the note
    for the past few days but I've made real progress. The pdfs when I added them to the website made the site slow so I had to make a
    GitHub repository so that I could link the pdfs to another webstie that I created but since the domain looks the same, no one
    would know. Genius, i know. Okay I admit that adding the pdfs was the most boring thing about this cause there were too many
    but it'll all be worth it. I hope it is.<br><br>

    Hey there <br>
    okay so it's been too long since I last wrote any notes and well things haven't gone exactly how I planned them and I'm happy cause the website is far better than what I
    first imagined it to be. I couldn't find a completely free and valid SSL certificate so I'm gonna have to live wihtout it, maybe I'll buy one in future.
    I obviously didn't finish the site by the end of september cause I altered my plans loads of times and I'm very glad I did.
    I added the songs yesterday, a few hindi ones are left. After that, I'll be done with the development end of the website.
    I'll scribble down my mind when your birthday's closer. The mutual buddies section is gonna be difficult to finish cause I'm not really sure
    where to contact two of them. I'll find a way, I have to. <br><br>
